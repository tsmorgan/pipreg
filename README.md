# Heroku Bootstrap Static Starter
I've just frozen this branch because it's a good starting point for a quick static site, using Bootstrap that you can chuck onto Heroku quickly. You'll need to grab the zip from this and stick it in another repo, but these files should be enough to get you started and they should work when deployed to Heroku. Enough for a little HTML messing around anyway.

Cheers
Tom
